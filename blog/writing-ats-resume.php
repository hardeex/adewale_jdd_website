                 Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to scan through millions of resumes and select the best from the list. Many applicants complained about 
                 never being called for an interview despite submitting several resumes.The truth is that each resume probably 
                 didn't pass through the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). <br> <br>

               <h3 id="what-is-ats">what is <abbr title="Applicant Tracking System">Applicant Tracking System (ATS)</abbr>?</h3>
               <p>Applicant Tracking System (ATS) are application software that scans curriculum vitae or resumes and other job recruitment documents, 
                such as cover letter for relevant keyword, that is, words or terms that are specific to the job. The <abbr title="Applicant Tracking System">Applicant Tracking System (ATS)</abbr>
                 ATS scan your resume right from the career objective to the last part of your resume. When writing your resume, you should embed essential keywords in 
                 headings such as the career summary, educational background, skills, and job titles to increase your chance of employment.
               </p>
               <p>
                
        A common mistake is submitting the same resume for all job roles. Each job has keywords associated with it; each 
        employer have specific skills or values they are seeking. Before submitting a resume, ensure the essential keywords 
        from the job posting or advert are embedded in your resume. Read the job description carefully, find what the employer wants, the employer
         values and input them in your resume. Please, don't lie in your resume/CV but don't belittle yourself. </p> <br>




               <h3 id="how-does-ATS-works">how does <abbr title="Applicant Tracking System">APPLICANT TRACKING SYSTEM (ATS)</abbr> works?</h3>
               <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/resume.cdn/articles/posts/dc9c6a16f85d5db665059e36b0a2af10-9241196_atsinfographic.png" alt="how-does-ats-work image" class="ats-image" >
               <p>
                The <abbr title="Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>  system categorizes a resume's content before scanning it for precise 
                and relevant keywords to decide whether or not the job application should be forwarded to the recruiter.
            It parses the resume into a category and scans the documents for relevant keywords to determine whether or not to pass 
            the documents to the recruiter. <br> It helps to disqualify candidates that do not fit the job description and choose the best 
            candidates from the pool of resume lists. 
            Each employment agency or employers submit certain keyword to the <abbr title="Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr> software. <br>
            The software searches for the keywords which are submitted in the recruiter database. Any resume not selected is truncated, that is not selected for the job interview. 
            This means that if a well-qualified candidate does not a write an <abbr title="Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>  friendly resume, then he or she won't have a chance of 
            getting interviewed for the job
               </p> <br>



               <h3 id="what-companies-uses-ats">what kind of companies uses <abbr title="Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>  for sorting resume</h3>
               <p>
                All resumes that are submitted online probably pass through the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). When submitting a 
                resume or other recruitment documents, ensure they are ATS-friendly and use a friendly ATS resume template.
                 The software is aimed at large corporations that must review multiple resumes regularly. It is better 
                 to assume that all resumes and other recruitment documents pass through
                  <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr> .
               </p>



               <h3 id="resume-styling">what styling should i use for my resume?</h3>
               <p>The  <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>  software is not designed to read graphics and images. 
                When writing your resume for  <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr> , you should keep
                 this in mind. Choose fonts you can easily read and avoid any font colour other than black. 
                 A font size of 10 pt, 12 pt, or 13 pt is okay for paragraphs and 14 pt, 16 pt, or 18 pt for headings. </p>
               <p>
                Time News Roman and Arial are the best standout fonts for an  <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>  resume, but your other fonts, 
                like Cambria, Georgia, Calibri, and Verdana, are also proven to be  <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>-friendly.   
               </p>

               <h3 id="ats-resume-template">what is <abbr title=" APPLICANT TRACKING SYSTEM">ATS</abbr>  resume template?</h3>
               <p>
               Using the wrong template for a resume can result in your resume remaining in the software's black hole 
               for eternity. Whatever design template you choose for your resume, simplicity is the primary goal. 
               Second, the <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>  software prefers the chronological resume format. Unless you have numerous work experiences or 
               have worked on multiple projects, your resume should not be longer than two pages. Choosing a good resume template 
               can help you achieve this.
               </p> <br>
               
               
               
               <h3 id="resume-file-format"> what file format should i submit for ats </h3>
               <p>The majority of job applicants are accustomed to submitting documents in PDF format. 
                Nothing is wrong with this, but research has shown that the <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr> 
                is not so friendly with this file format. Unless the PDF file format is listed among the file formats that 
                you can submit, it is best to submit the .doc or .docx format of your resume. <br> PDFs are best for preserving 
                your resume designs, but they are not the most <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>-friendly 
                file type because they are not compatible with all <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr> 
                 software. So why not play it safe?
               </p> <br>



               <h3 id="check-my-resume"> how to check if my resume is <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>  friendly</h3>
               <p>Before submitting your resume for jobs, it is good practice to check if your resume is <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>-friendly.
                 There are two ways to check if your resume is <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>  resume friendly for job searches </p>

                <div class="inside-list" id="inside-list">
                    <ul>

                        The plain-text version of your resume won't be <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>
                         compatible if it lacks important information from your original resume, contains wrongly preserved 
                         characters, or appears unorganized (for example, the header for your "Education" section 
                         appears during your job experience).</p>

               <h3 id="avoid-on-resume">what i should avoid on my resume to make it ATS friendly </h3>
               <p>
                A bad habit is copying a resume online or from a friend without in-depth proofreading. You can always seek 
                better ways to make your resume the best, but don't copy and paste even an expertly written resume. 
                It is your personal experience; it is unique.
               </p>
               <p>The following are some best practices for <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>  resume. 
                Ensure the following are in properly checked before submitting your resume</p>
               <ol>
                <li>avoid abbreviation
                   <p>write your words in full. For example, write Bachelor of science (B.Sci) instead of B.sci</p> 
                    <img src="https://www.jobscan.co/wp-content/uploads/CPA.png" alt="abbreviation image" class="ats-image" >
                </li>
                <li>
                   <p>Don't use a table on your resume; bullet your points. When bulleting your point, 
                    avoid using symbols or stars. Use a circle or square bullets for ordered list bullets. </p>  
                    <img src="https://www.jobscan.co/wp-content/uploads/bullet-points.png" alt="bullet-styling image" class="ats-image" >
                </li>
                <li>
                   <p> Avoid extra spaces between words. For example, the following words are interpreted separately by the 
                    <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr> : project manager and project  manager. the latter has extra 
                    space between the product and the manager</p> 
                </li>
                <li> <p>Enter dates in the format MM/YYYY. for example 02/2023 </p> </li>
                <li>
                   <p>Save the file name with your first and last name to avoid your resume being truncated by the <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>. 
                    For example, save the file as jamiuyusuf.docx</p> 
                </li>
                <li>
                   <p>Avoid the header and footer. Don't put essential details in the header and/or footer of your resume.
                     You've probably guessed by now that there are various types of <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>
                      software. Not all of this software has the capability of parsing information in the header and footer of documents.
                       Information such as names, emails, phone numbers, links should be written outside the header and footer of 
                       your Word document resume. </p> 
                </li>
                <li><p>Avoid images, charts, and graphics. Some ats software tends to have issues parsing images, charts and graphics on resume </p> </li>
                <li>
                   <p>Optimize your resume using <a href="https://www.online-utility.org/text/analyzer.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keyoword optimizer</a>. 
                    Use keywords relevant to the position or role for which you are applying.
                    If you're unsure of the best resume keywords, start by gathering three to five job descriptions that best describe the position
                     you want. <br> Then, put the job description into a free tool that measures word and phrase frequency to find the phrases that are
                      often used throughout the job description for the roles in which you're interested. Include the phrases in your CV if 
                      you meet the requirements or have the abilities listed in the job posting.</p> <br>
                    <p>Consider the frequency and placement of these essential keywords throughout your resume while building an 
                        <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>-optimized resume. Depending on how frequently a term appears 
                        in your resume (aim to include the term two to three times throughout your resume), some applicant tracking 
                        systems (ATS) will assess the strength of your skills, while others will assign an estimated amount of experience
                         for a given skill based on where it appears in the resume. You should optimize your resume for both systems
                          if you want it to be fully compatible with either <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>.</p> <br>
                <p>
                    Depending on how long you held the position, some applicant tracking systems will correlate the length of experience for 
                    the skill with your employment history. When you state that you handled Product Design for the firm at your previous employment 
                    and you worked there for five years, the <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr> will infer that you have 
                    five years of SEO expertise from that position. The <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr> scan give a skill 
                    six months' experience if it mentioned on its own, such as in a core-competencies section or professional profile. 
                    Because of this, it's crucial that you highlight your skills across the entirety of your resume rather than simply in the 
                    skill area at the beginning of the <abbr title=" Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr> resume template.
                </p>
                </li> <br>
                <li><p>Use a simple design template</p> </li>
                <li>
                   <p> Use a chronological resume format or style that focuses on work history and avoid the functional resume format that focuses on abilities</p></li>
                <li> avoid fluff
                    <p>Words like "passionate," "professional," "expert, specialized, creative and the like are perceived as marketing fluff by recruiters. 
                        Learn where and how to insert those words in your resume.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Your previous job role's roles and responsibilities should speak more to achievement than tasking. 
                    What recruiters want to know is how you have used your skills to help the companies you've worked for, 
                    not what you were tasked with. </p>
